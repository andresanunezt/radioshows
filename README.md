# Red Triangle Radio Webapp
Welcome to the webapplication of Red Triangle Radio, a fictional radio station. Red Triangle Radio djs can use this application to make a username and upload lists of songs played on their radio shows.

## Motivation
As part of the staff in college radio, the upload of a dj's weekly playlist was a complicated, multi-step process. That inspired me to attempt to create a simple webapp where dj's can upload their own playlists and have them up for display.
## Installation
Simply run `bundle install`.
Once all the appropriate gems are installed accessing the webpp can be done through `shotgun` or any other local server.

## Usage
Red Triangle Radio djs can use this application to make a username and upload lists of songs played on their radio shows. Djs can create, read , update and delete their own playlists.
